App passwords :

 * app passwords only make sense for corresponding mailbox entries; i.e an admin shouldn't be able to create one for themself.
 * admins should be able to add them for user(s) (need to check domain permission)
 * Fix query in the dovecot integration example - it does not work - see https://github.com/postfixadmin/postfixadmin/issues/802

Probably need a Process class to put the various proc_open stuff in?
